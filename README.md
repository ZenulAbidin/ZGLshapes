# ZGLshapes
### Zenul_Abidin's OpenGL shape classes

There are no libraries which can create and manipulate 2D and 3D shapes in a framework-independent manner. ZGLshapes aims to bridge the gap by providing a set of classes that represent the most common shapes, and ways to export them into screen-drawable objects.

Currently these classes depend on Qt5, and there are only 2D shapes for now.

This code is **experimental**. It may not compile.
